This repository provides the **code base and project index** supporting the paper:

> **Populating Urban Digital Twins with Humans:  
> A Framework Utilizing Artificial Agents**

The goal of this project is to develop a **modular, reproducible agent-based modeling (ABM) framework** for populating urban digital twins with artificial human agents, enabling the simulation of mobility, interaction, evacuation, opinion dynamics, and epidemiological processes in spatially explicit urban environments.

---

## Core Methodological Foundation

### Geographically Explicit Synthetic Population

Several models in this repository rely on a geographically explicit synthetic population framework to initialize realistic human agents:

- **Synthetic Population Generation Framework**  
  https://github.com/njiang8/geo-synthetic-pop-usa  

This framework provides:
- Census-consistent synthetic individuals
- Spatially explicit population distributions
- A scalable foundation for urban-scale digital twin simulations
